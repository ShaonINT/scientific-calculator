# SB Scientific Calculator

A modern, mobile-first scientific calculator built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

SB Scientific Calculator(https://shaonint.github.io/scientific-calculator/))

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Standard Operations**: Basic arithmetic with a clean, responsive UI.
- **Scientific Functions**: Trigonometry (`sin`, `cos`, `tan` and inverses), Logarithms (`log`, `ln`, `logₐx`), and Powers (`x²`, `x^y`, `10ˣ`).
- **History**: View and recall past calculations by tapping the history icon.

### Advanced Tools
- **Calculus**:
  - **Differentiation**: `d/dx` (Numerical derivative).
  - **Integration**: `∫dx` (Definite integral using Simpson's Rule).
  - **Summation**: `Σ` (Sum of a series).
  - **Product**: `Π` (Product of a series).
- **Engineering Tools**:
  - **ENG**: Cycle results through engineering exponents (10³, 10⁶, etc.).
  - **DEG / m→d**: Convert between Decimal and Degrees-Minutes-Seconds (`D°M'S"`).
  - **S⇔D**: Toggle between Decimal and Fraction results.
  - **Modulus**: Calculate remainders with `mod`.
  - **Absolute Value**: Calculate `|x|` with `Abs`.
  - **Custom Root**: Calculate `ⁿ√x` with `yroot`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Modern variables, Flexbox/Grid, and responsive design for all devices (Mobile to Desktop).
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Robust parsing logic (no `eval` for complex functions), custom math implementation, and event handling.

## 📦 Installation & Usage
